torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 11.96 GiB. GPU  has a total capacity of 47.54 GiB of which 10.09 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 37.44 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 37.08 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 31.81 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
